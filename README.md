## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

I'm still thinking that there are some parts to improve at this list: one of them is the component active state, like increment and decrement button which, by the way, I had serious troubles to solve. The .svg file extension was difficult to manage for me, especaially when I tried to style with Tailwind's classes.

On the other hand, I had the opportunity to put in practice a complex logic that is the useReducer hook from React. I think the results was satisfactory, but I'm wondering whether is another way or better practice to implement this excellent and useful tool.
